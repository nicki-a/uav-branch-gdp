### How do I get set up? ###

* The entire program starts from mqtt-comms-unit
* It should automatically call system_control
* Each script that needs to talk to other scripts uses mqtt_pub commands to do so

* mqtt-comms-unit processes each command
* The possible commands are all listed at the bottom of mqtt-comms-unit, with a registered handler functions
